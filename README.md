WCA Badge
=========

This repository contains my "WCA Badge", which can be found at
[http://cube.hackvalue.de/badge/](http://cube.hackvalue.de/badge/).
It generates a small banner with personalized statistics about
user profiles in the database of the
[World Cube Association](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/).

The badge is extensively used by german speedcubers as signatures
in web forums (I get about 10.000 hits per day on this thing).
I really hate PHP, but it was the easiest and fastest solution
at that time. The code is really ugly. Sorry for that. It was
a quick and dirty hack :-(

You need a local copy of the WCA database in order to run this yourself.
